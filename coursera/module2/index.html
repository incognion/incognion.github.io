            <p> <q> Even considering your own duty you should not waver (from the fight). Since there is nothing else
                    better
                    for a kshatriya than a righteous battle.</q> <br> <b> Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse
                    31.</b> <br> Swadharma
                means your Dharma.
                Swadharma is not really different from Dharma, but Dharma merely says, “Come to the origin.” Dharma
                says, “Come to the origin, become zero.” Come to the point where everything is dissolved, nothing exists;
                come to zero. That is DHarma.</p>

            <p> Liberation is Dharma. To move to the point where one stands liberated alone is Dharma. But when we
                define &#39dharma&#39 this way, then we are talking of only one point, the point to which you have to
                reach. We are calling that as the point of liberation. But nobody stands at a position called &#39no
                position&#39. We all stand somewhere, and wherever we stand, that point is actually a point of
                conditioning. Had we not been standing somewhere, there was no need to travel to be liberated.</p>

            <p>If a Brahmin is there on the same battlefield, Krishna would advise him to resist the Kauravas, but in
                some way that is most suited to the Brahmin&#39s own conditioning. If he tells the Brahmin to pick up
                the bow and arrow, or mace, and start fighting Duryodhana, then the war is lost already.
                So, the Brahmin will have to fight Duryodhana, no doubt, but in the way of the Brahmin.
                The Vaishya and the Shudra too will have to fight Duryodhana but in their own respective ways. </p>
